# Vanilla

**Vanilla** is Vanilla's design system, delivered as a set of *skills*. Turn it on and the interfaces you build belong to the same visual family — recognizably Vanilla — while each product keeps its own layout and personality.

> **The skin is Vanilla; the soul is the product's.**

The *skin* (color, type, depth, icons) is fixed and guarantees recognition; the *soul* (domain, layout, hierarchy, and each product's *signature*) is free. Vanilla handles the *craft* — hierarchy, accessible primitives, polish, motion, states — so every UI ships with product quality, without looking "AI-generated."

These are plain `SKILL.md` skills, **portable across Claude Code and OpenCode** (no subagents, plugins, or environment-specific config).

## Concept

What is **non-negotiable** (the skin — identical across every Vanilla project):

- Palette and color · **Inter** type · lavender accent (used sparingly)
- *Surface ladder* (canvas → surface-1..4) and *hairlines*
- Radius and spacing scales · **Lucide** icons
- **Headless primitives** for controls (Base UI in React, Reka UI in Vue) — never a styled UI kit

What is **free** (the soul — decided per product):

- Layout, composition, hierarchy, and focus · density within range
- Which screens/components exist · content and voice
- The **signature** — the one element that could only exist in *this* product

Rule of thumb: if the change alters *what the Vanilla brand looks like*, it's skin (fixed). If it alters *what this product does/prioritizes*, it's soul (free).

## The 6 skills

| Skill | Role | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **`vanilla`** | Hub / orchestrator | Entry point for building any Vanilla product UI |
| **`vanilla-discovery`** | Interview the soul | At the start of a new project, before any code |
| **`vanilla-build`** | Construction | Build or extend the UI from the brief |
| **`vanilla-review`** | Taste pass | Judge craft, family, and soul before merge |
| **`vanilla-audit`** | Evidence pass | Verify the measurable quality before merge |
| **`vanilla-direction`** | Extra character | When the product needs stronger visual personality |

### `vanilla` — the hub

The entry point. Loads the family (`design.md`, `tokens.css`, `theme.css`, `motion.md`) and runs the `discover → build → review & audit` flow (+ direction on demand), invoking the satellites in the right order. It's lightweight: it orchestrates, it doesn't duplicate.

### `vanilla-discovery` — the soul

A **short interview** that captures what makes the product unique: real user, task, domain, *feel*, **signature**, and stack (framework, Tailwind, theme). It persists everything to a **`vanilla-brief.md`** in the project's `docs/vanilla/`. This is the main **antidote to convergence** (the risk that every Vanilla product comes out the same). On a new project, it offers `git init` before writing.

### `vanilla-build` — the construction

Builds the UI **from the brief**, applying the skin (tokens) with real *craft*: hierarchy (weight + color + ink ramp, not just size), the *surface ladder*, polish, motion < 300ms, complete states. Uses **headless primitives** (Base UI / Reka UI) and **Lucide** icons. Applies the **theme** (dark / light / both with a toggle + anti-FOUC script) and the **brand override** if there is one.

### `vanilla-review` — the taste pass

A **strict** review against three bars:

1. **Craft** — would a design lead put their name on it? (hierarchy, restraint, polish)
2. **Family** — is it unmistakably Vanilla? (tokens, Inter, surface ladder, Lucide, primitives)
3. **Soul** — does it carry the brief's *signature*, or could it be any product?

Judges by default (reports findings + verdict, severity *Blocker / Should-fix / Note*); rebuilds only when you ask.

### `vanilla-audit` — the evidence pass

The *measurable* sibling of `vanilla-review`. Where review judges what only a person can, audit verifies what a machine can: **WCAG contrast** on both themes (via `references/contrast.mjs`), **token fidelity** (no hardcoded hex/px, no undefined vars, no off-scale type/space), responsive and touch targets, complete interaction/data states, and family-mechanical conformance (Lucide, headless primitives, surface ladder). Run **both** before merge — review for taste, audit for evidence. Reports findings by severity; fixes only when asked.

### `vanilla-direction` — the character

Invoked **on demand**, when the brief's *feel* asks for more personality. It decides **where to spend boldness within the fixed skin** — amplifying the signature, the layout, the motion, the density, and the expressive use of Inter — and spends it in one place. It never repaints the skin (a new color/font/icon set = a violation).

## The flow

```
        ┌─────────────────────────── vanilla (hub) ───────────────────────────┐
        │                                                                      │
   1. discover ──▶ vanilla-brief.md ──▶ 3. build ──▶ UI on the skin ──▶ 4. review + audit ──▶ verdict
  (vanilla-discovery)   (the soul)      (vanilla-build)        (vanilla-review · vanilla-audit)
        │                                                                      │
        └── 2. direction (optional, when the product needs character) ─────────┘
```

1. **Discover** — the interview produces `vanilla-brief.md`. *This is where the soul lives.*
2. **Direction** *(optional)* — amplifies character within the skin.
3. **Build** — the UI is assembled on top of the skin, guided by the brief.
4. **Review & audit** — taste (`vanilla-review`) plus evidence (`vanilla-audit`). Ship only when both clear.

## The skin

The skin lives in `.claude/skills/vanilla/references/`:

- **`design.md`** — the semantic source (the "why" behind each decision).
- **`tokens.css`** — the canonical technical source: CSS custom properties (`--vanilla-*`).
- **`theme.css`** — the **Tailwind v4** preset (`@theme`) that *references* `tokens.css` (never redeclaring values).
- **`motion.md`** — the family's motion layer (curves, durations, the decision-before-how discipline).
- **`contrast.mjs`** — the WCAG contrast checker over the tokens (used by `vanilla-audit`).

The `design.md → tokens.css → theme.css` chain makes Tailwind **inherit the skin at runtime**: change one value in `tokens.css` and it propagates everywhere, with no rebuild.

### Themes (dark / light)

Dark is the default and the family's face. Light is the **same skin inverted** (`:root[data-theme="light"]`): same Inter, same lavender (with the value tuned to pass AA), inverted surface ladder + shadows for elevation. Choose per project at discovery: **dark / light / both**. "Both" generates a toggle (Lucide sun/moon) with persistence and an anti-FOUC script (key `vanilla-theme`).

### Brand override (light)

If the project supplies a reference `design.md` (format `@google/design.md`, e.g. a client's brand), `vanilla-build` applies a **light brand adjustment**: it extracts **only** the primary color, the secondaries, the spacing scale, and the radius scale, and overrides the matching tokens. Everything else stays Vanilla. It's a reviewable override — not the adoption of another skin.

---

## Default stack

| Layer | Choice | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Type | **Inter** (+ JetBrains Mono) | Fixed part of the skin |
| CSS | **Tailwind v4** (`theme.css` preset) | Recommended, not required — without Tailwind, import `tokens.css` |
| Primitives | **Base UI** (React) · **Reka UI** (Vue) | Headless; never a styled UI kit (Material/Vuetify/Chakra/Ant) |
| Icons | **Lucide** | `lucide-react` / `lucide-vue-next` — same icons in both frameworks |

```

---

## Installation

The skills are read by both Claude Code and OpenCode, from `.claude/skills/` or `~/.claude/skills/`.

### One-liner (recommended)

The repo is public, so a single command installs everything — no clone needed:

```bash
# Global — available in every project (installs to ~/.claude/skills/)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maclevison/vanilla/main/install.sh | bash

# Per-project — into a target repo's .claude/skills/
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maclevison/vanilla/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --project ./my-app
```

### From a clone

For contributors, or to track updates with a symlink:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maclevison/vanilla.git
cd vanilla-ai
./install.sh                 # global, into ~/.claude/skills/
./install.sh --project .     # into ./.claude/skills/
./install.sh --link          # symlink instead of copy — pull to update
```

### Manual

Copy the `vanilla*` folders from `.claude/skills/` into the target repo's `.claude/skills/`, or into `~/.claude/skills/` for a global install.

> This repository ships a `.gitignore` that overrides the global ignore of `**/.claude/`, so that `.claude/skills/` is versioned here (while the rest of `.claude/`, such as `settings.local.json`, stays ignored).

---

## Usage

Ask the agent to use the `vanilla` skill when building product UI. The hub loads the family and runs the discover → build → review flow.

Prompt examples:

```
/vanilla I want to build a dashboard that monitors user status.
```
```
use the vanilla skill to create this app's settings screen
```

From there, the hub interviews the product (discovery), builds on top of the skin (build), and can review/audit it. For a new project, it offers to initialize git and writes the brief to `docs/vanilla/`.

---

## Conventions

- **Artifacts generated** by the skills (the brief, direction notes, reports) live in the target project's **`docs/vanilla/`** — never loose in the root.
- **New project:** discovery **offers `git init`** before writing anything.
- **`vanilla-brief.md`** is the soul's anchor: produced by `vanilla-discovery`, consumed by `vanilla-build`, and used by `vanilla-review` as the uniqueness test.

---

## Development

Run the validator after editing skills or tokens:

```bash
node scripts/validate-skills.mjs
```

It's a dependency-free Node script. It runs 7 checks:

1. **Portability** of every skill — `name` in kebab-case, matching the folder name, with no `:` (OpenCode-compatible).
2. **Token chain** — `theme.css` references `tokens.css` via `var()` and never redeclares hex in `@theme`.
3. **Brief template** present in `vanilla-discovery`.
4. **`vanilla-build`** references the skin and the brief (tokens, Base UI/Reka UI, Lucide).
5. **`vanilla-review`** references the brief, the skin, and the *signature* test.
6. **`vanilla-direction`** keeps the skin fixed (Inter, surface ladder, Lucide).
7. **Light theme** — `tokens.css` ships the `:root[data-theme="light"]` block with the core tokens.

You can also audit the skin's contrast directly:

```bash
node .claude/skills/vanilla/references/contrast.mjs        # check the skin pairs on both themes
node .claude/skills/vanilla/references/contrast.mjs <fg> <bg>   # ad-hoc product pair
```

## Specs & plans

The system was designed with brainstorming → spec → plan, reviewed at each step. Everything is versioned in:

- **Specs:** `docs/superpowers/specs/`
  - `2026-06-25-vanilla-design-system-skill.md` — the system (hub + satellites)
  - `2026-06-25-vanilla-light-mode-design.md` — dark + light
- **Plans:** `docs/superpowers/plans/` — one implementation plan per phase.
